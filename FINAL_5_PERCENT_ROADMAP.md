SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=[Production Wallet Key]
PROGRAM_ID=[Production Program Address]
FLBY_TOKEN_MINT=[FLBY Token Mint Address]
```

### Day 3-4: FLBY Token Deployment
```javascript
// Token Creation Parameters:
{
  name: "Flutterbye",
  symbol: "FLBY", 
  decimals: 9,
  totalSupply: 1000000000, // 1 billion tokens
  mintAuthority: [Multi-sig wallet],
  freezeAuthority: [Multi-sig wallet]
}
```

### Day 5-6: WebSocket Optimization
```javascript
// Enhanced Reconnection Logic:
const reconnectConfig = {
  maxRetries: 10,
  baseDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  backoffFactor: 1.5,
  healthCheck: true
}
```

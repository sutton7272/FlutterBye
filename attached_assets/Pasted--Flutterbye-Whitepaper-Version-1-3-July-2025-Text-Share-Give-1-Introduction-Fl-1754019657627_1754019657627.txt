# Flutterbye Whitepaper

Version 1.3 – July 2025
*“Text. Share. Give.”*

## 1. Introduction

Flutterbye is a blockchain-powered messaging and value distribution protocol built on the Solana network. It enables users to create and send 27-character tokenized messages, each minted as a custom SPL coin. These micro-messages—called Fluttercoins**—can carry value, emotion, or calls to action in an elegant, viral, and programmable form.

Flutterbye is not just a messaging app—it's a new medium for value-rich communication, airdrops, virality, and engagement in Web3.

## **2. What Makes Flutterbye Unique?

* 🪶 Each message is a coin: Every message up to 27 characters becomes the name of a new SPL token.
* 🎯 Targeted minting: Send tokens to specific wallets via top-holder targeting or CSV upload.
* 💸 Value attachment: Minted tokens can carry SOL or SPL token value (optional).
* 🔄 Refund-to-credit system: Unclaimed tokens can be reclaimed and turned into credits for future mints.
* 🧠 Anti-spam design: Human-readable, meme-worthy tokens reduce bot filtering and increase wallet attention.
* 🌍 Composable and open: Designed for integrations with DeFi protocols, social tools, and marketing platforms.

## 3. Use Cases

* Viral Growth Campaigns
  Mint tokens like “JoinTheHiveNow” or “Stake4Rewards” and drop them to high-value wallets.

* Gift or Tip with Purpose
  Send “YouAreAwesome” coins with \$1 of SOL to a friend. Redeemable, collectible, and social.

* Airdrop with Personality
  Replace bland airdrops with meme-driven, emotionally engaging messages people remember.

* Referral Rewards
  Share “MyRefCode123” coins; receivers who redeem trigger affiliate logic.

* Coupon Distribution
  Businesses can mint tokens like “Save10Today” that act as redeemable coupons or discount tokens.

## 4. How It Works

### Step 1: Mint a Message Token

* Enter a message (max 27 characters)
* Choose:

  * Custom image (optional)
  * Amount to mint
  * Value per token (optional)
  * Target wallets (CSV upload, top holder API, or manual entry)

> Example:
> Message: “StakeNowForYield”
> Value: 0.25 SOL
> Targets: Top 500 stakers of SOL

All unused minted tokens are automatically returned to the sender’s connected wallet.

---

### Step 2: Distribution Logic

#### Targeting Options

* 📊 Top Wallet Holders: Query API to find top holders of a given token.
* 📥 CSV Upload: Upload wallet address list.
* 📋 Manual Entry: Paste individual wallet addresses.

#### Distribution Methods

* Instant airdrop via Solana transaction
* Scheduled dispersal
* Public link share or QR code (optional, in Phase 2)

---

### Step 3: Redemption & Refund-to-Credit

* If a user claims the token, they receive:

  * The message token (collectible or tradable)
  * Any attached SOL or SPL value
* If not claimed within X days:

  * Sender receives credit in their account for future minting
  * Flutterbye earns a fee (e.g. 10%) from expired value

---

## 5. Token Standards & Protocol Design

* Tokens are SPL standard and readable on SolScan and Phantom.
* Each coin name = the 27-character message (e.g., IMISSYOUFLYHIGHBABY)
* Optional metadata includes:

  * Custom image
  * Attached memo
  * Creator wallet address
* All minted tokens are fully transferable and visible in wallet interfaces.

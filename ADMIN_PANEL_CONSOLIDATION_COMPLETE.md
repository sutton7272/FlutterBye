- **Quick Actions**: Direct access to common administrative tasks

### Performance Benefits
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Eliminated 7 separate admin page components
- **Faster Navigation**: No page reloads between admin functions
- **Shared Resources**: Common components and styles loaded once
- **Optimized Queries**: Consolidated API calls and data fetching

## Migration from Separate Pages

### Replaced Components
1. `admin.tsx` → Overview tab (main dashboard functionality)
2. `admin-system.tsx` → Settings tab (platform configuration)
3. `admin-pricing.tsx` → Pricing tab (fee management)
4. `admin-free-codes.tsx` → Codes tab (redemption management)
5. `admin-early-access.tsx` → Access tab (launch controls)
6. `admin-analytics.tsx` → Analytics tab (metrics)
7. `admin-staking.tsx` → Staking tab (FLBY configuration)
8. `admin-default-image.tsx` → Tokens tab (image management)

### Routing Updates
- **New Primary Route**: `/admin` → Unified dashboard
- **Legacy Route**: `/admin-legacy` → Original admin page (backup)
- **Removed Routes**: All separate admin page routes eliminated
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Tabs replace separate page navigation

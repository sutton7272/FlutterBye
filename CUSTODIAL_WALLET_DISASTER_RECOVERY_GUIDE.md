# Custodial Wallet Disaster Recovery Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to recover funds from Flutterbye custodial wallets in disaster scenarios using encrypted backup files.

## Backup System
- **Security Level**: AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Private Keys**: Never displayed in UI, only encrypted backups available
- **Banking Standards**: Follows enterprise security protocols
- **Audit Trail**: All backup operations are logged for compliance

## Creating Secure Backups

### 1. Access Custodial Wallet Management
- Navigate to `/admin-custodial-wallet`
- Locate the wallet you want to backup
- Click the green "Backup" button in the Security & Recovery section

### 2. Backup File Contents
Each backup file contains:
```json
{
  "walletId": "unique-wallet-identifier",
  "currency": "SOL|USDC|FLBY",
  "walletAddress": "public-wallet-address",
  "encryptedPrivateKey": "AES-256-encrypted-private-key",
  "backupDate": "ISO-timestamp",
  "recoveryInstructions": "detailed-instructions",
  "securityLevel": "AES-256",
  "requiresDecryptionKey": true
}
```

### 3. Backup File Security
- Files are named: `wallet-backup-{CURRENCY}-{ADDRESS}-{TIMESTAMP}.json`
- Contains encrypted private key data only
- Requires decryption keys to access funds
- Store in multiple secure locations

## Fund Recovery Process

### Emergency Recovery Steps

#### 1. Gather Required Items
- ‚úÖ Backup file (.json)
- ‚úÖ Decryption keys (stored separately)
- ‚úÖ Recovery environment (secure computer)
- ‚úÖ Solana CLI tools or compatible wallet software

#### 2. Decrypt Private Key
```bash
# Example decryption process (implementation specific)
# This requires the encryption key used during wallet creation
openssl enc -d -aes-256-gcm -in encrypted_key -out private_key.txt
```

#### 3. Import to Recovery Wallet
```bash
# Import private key to Solana CLI
solana-keygen recover --force --outfile recovery-wallet.json

# Or import to compatible wallet software
# Follow wallet-specific import procedures
```

#### 4. Transfer Funds
```bash
# Check balance
solana balance recovery-wallet.json

# Transfer to new secure wallet
solana transfer <NEW_WALLET_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --from recovery-wallet.json
```

## Security Considerations

### Critical Security Rules
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never share private keys or decryption keys**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use secure, offline computers for recovery**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Verify wallet addresses before transfers**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Delete recovery files after use**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test recovery process with small amounts first**

### Multi-Signature Recovery
For high-value wallets requiring multiple signatures:
1. Coordinate with authorized signers
2. Use multi-sig recovery procedures
3. Follow enterprise approval workflows
4. Document all recovery actions

### Compliance Requirements
- All recovery operations must be logged
- Maintain audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Report significant fund movements
- Follow internal approval processes

## Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Server Failure
**Situation**: Primary servers are down, need access to funds
**Solution**: Use backup files to recover to external wallets

### Scenario 2: Database Corruption
**Situation**: Database is corrupted, wallet data inaccessible
**Solution**: Restore from backup files and recreate wallet infrastructure

### Scenario 3: Key Compromise
**Situation**: Encryption keys may be compromised
**Solution**: Immediately transfer funds using backup files to new secure wallets

### Scenario 4: Infrastructure Migration
**Situation**: Moving to new infrastructure or providers
**Solution**: Use backup files to migrate wallet access seamlessly

## Testing Recovery Process

### Monthly Testing Checklist
- [ ] Verify backup file integrity
- [ ] Test decryption process with test keys
- [ ] Validate wallet import procedures
- [ ] Confirm transfer capabilities
- [ ] Update recovery documentation

### Test Wallet Setup
1. Create test wallets with small amounts
2. Generate backup files
3. Practice recovery procedures
4. Document any issues or improvements
5. Train authorized personnel

## Emergency Contacts

### Internal Team
- **Primary**: System Administrator
- **Secondary**: Security Officer
- **Backup**: Technical Lead

### External Support
- **Solana Support**: For blockchain-specific issues
- **Infrastructure Provider**: For hosting/server issues
- **Legal Counsel**: For compliance questions

## Recovery Time Estimates

| Scenario | Recovery Time | Complexity |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Single Wallet | 15-30 minutes | Low |
| Multiple Wallets | 1-3 hours | Medium |
| Full Infrastructure | 4-8 hours | High |
| Complex Multi-Sig | 8-24 hours | Very High |

## Post-Recovery Actions

### Immediate Steps
1. ‚úÖ Verify all funds are secure
2. ‚úÖ Update wallet infrastructure
3. ‚úÖ Generate new backup files
4. ‚úÖ Update security procedures
5. ‚úÖ Document recovery actions

### Long-term Actions
1. ‚úÖ Review and improve backup procedures
2. ‚úÖ Update disaster recovery plans
3. ‚úÖ Train additional personnel
4. ‚úÖ Implement additional security measures
5. ‚úÖ Regular recovery testing schedule

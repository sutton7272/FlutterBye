# Create Smaller Deployment Package

## Problem: ZIP file too large (over 500MB limit)

## Solution: Create deployment-only ZIP

### Files to INCLUDE (Essential only):
- package.json
- package-lock.json (if exists)
- client/ folder (entire folder)
- server/ folder (entire folder)
- shared/ folder (entire folder)
- public/ folder (if exists)
- vite.config.ts
- tsconfig.json
- tailwind.config.ts
- drizzle.config.ts
- .ebignore (the file we just created)

### Files to EXCLUDE (Large/unnecessary):
- node_modules/ (AWS will install)
- attached_assets/ (over 400MB of images)
- All .md files (documentation)
- .git/ folder
- Any build/dist folders
- Log files
- .env files (we'll add env vars in AWS)

### Instructions:
1. **Cancel current deployment**
2. **Create new ZIP with only essential files**
3. **New ZIP should be under 50MB**
4. **Try deployment again**

This should resolve the file size issue and allow successful deployment.

# Replit Support Request - Database Migration Platform Issue

## Issue Summary
Cloud Run deployment failed during database migration phase due to platform infrastructure issue.

## Error Details
```
Database migrations could not be applied due to platform issue
Cloud Run deployment failed during migration phase
Infrastructure issue preventing database setup
```

## Project Information
- **Project Name**: FlutterBye
- **Project Type**: Full-stack TypeScript application with PostgreSQL database
- **Deployment Target**: Cloud Run
- **Issue Type**: Platform infrastructure - database migration system

## Current Status
- ✅ Development environment working normally (localhost)
- ✅ Application runs successfully in Replit workspace
- ✅ Database operations work in development
- ❌ Deployment fails during migration phase due to platform issue

## Technical Context
- Using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Database schema is properly configured
- Migrations work locally in development
- Issue appears to be Replit's deployment infrastructure, not application code

## Logs and Evidence
- Application runs successfully locally: Server active on port 5000
- WebSocket and all APIs functioning in development
- Error specifically mentions "platform issue" not application issue

## Request
Please investigate and resolve the database migration platform issue preventing Cloud Run deployment. This appears to be an infrastructure problem on Replit's deployment system rather than an application configuration issue.

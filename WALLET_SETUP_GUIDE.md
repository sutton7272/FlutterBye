# Flutterbye Wallet Setup Guide

## Current Wallet Status

When you add wallets through the admin dashboard, they are **database records only** and need additional setup to become functional for sending/receiving funds.

## Making Wallets Functional

### Step 1: Generate Real Solana Addresses
Each wallet needs an actual Solana keypair (public address + private key):

```javascript
// This would need to be added to the wallet creation process
import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
import bs58 from 'bs58';

const newKeypair = Keypair.generate();
const address = newKeypair.publicKey.toString();
const privateKey = bs58.encode(newKeypair.secretKey);
```

### Step 2: Secure Private Key Storage
- Private keys must be encrypted and stored securely
- Consider using environment variables or secure key management
- Never expose private keys in API responses

### Step 3: Fund the Wallets
For devnet testing:
- Request SOL from devnet faucet: https://faucet.solana.com/
- Or transfer from existing funded wallet

For mainnet:
- Transfer real SOL from external wallet
- Set up funding mechanisms

## Current Implementation Status

✅ **Working:**
- Database schema for wallets, transactions, alerts
- Admin interface for wallet management
- API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Type filtering (gas_funding, fee_collection, escrow, admin)

❌ **Missing for Full Functionality:**
- Automatic Solana keypair generation
- Secure private key storage/encryption
- Real balance checking from blockchain
- Transaction signing capabilities
- Automatic funding mechanisms

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

1. **Generate Real Keypairs:** Add Solana keypair generation to wallet creation
2. **Secure Storage:** Implement encrypted private key storage
3. **Balance Sync:** Connect to Solana RPC for real balance checking
4. **Transaction Logic:** Add signing and sending capabilities
5. **Funding Automation:** Set up funding workflows for gas wallets

## Security Considerations

- Private keys must never be exposed in logs or API responses
- Use proper encryption for stored private keys
- Implement wallet access controls
- Regular security audits for key management

## Development vs Production

**Current (Development):**
- Mock balances and addresses
- Safe for testing UI/UX
- No real funds at risk

**Production Ready:**
- Real Solana keypairs
- Encrypted private key storage
- Actual blockchain transactions
- Proper security measures

  decimals: 9,
  totalSupply: 1000000000, // 1 billion tokens
  mintAuthority: [Multi-sig production wallet],
  freezeAuthority: [Multi-sig production wallet],
  distribution: {
    public: 40%, // 400M tokens
    team: 20%,   // 200M tokens
    ecosystem: 25%, // 250M tokens
    treasury: 15%   // 150M tokens
  }
}
```

**Implementation Tasks:**

### 4. Production Security Hardening (Priority B)
**Goal:** Bank-level security for MainNet operations

**Security Requirements:**
- [ ] Private key management system
- [ ] Multi-signature transaction validation
- [ ] Cold storage integration
- [ ] Audit trail compliance
- [ ] Transaction monitoring alerts
- [ ] Fraud detection systems

### 5. Performance & Scalability (Priority B)

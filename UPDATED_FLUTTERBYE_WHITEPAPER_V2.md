## 1. Introduction

Flutterbye is a revolutionary blockchain-powered messaging and value distribution protocol built on the Solana network. It enables users to create and send 27-character tokenized messages, each minted as a custom SPL coin. These micro-messages—called **Fluttercoins**—can carry value, emotion, or calls to action in an elegant, viral, and programmable form.

Flutterbye is not just a messaging app—it's a new medium for value-rich communication, airdrops, virality, and engagement in Web3, enhanced by industry-first collaborative features and AI-powered optimization.

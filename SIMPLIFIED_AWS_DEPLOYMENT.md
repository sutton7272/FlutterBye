# Simplified AWS Deployment - No Local Setup Required

## Step 3: Create AWS Account
1. **Go to** https://aws.amazon.com
2. **Click "Create AWS Account"**
3. **Fill in your email, password, account name**
4. **Add payment method** (they have free tier - won't charge unless you exceed limits)
5. **Verify phone number**
6. **Choose "Basic support" (free)**

## Step 4: Deploy Using AWS Amplify (Easiest Method)

AWS Amplify can deploy directly from your code without local setup.

### Option A: Deploy from ZIP file
1. **AWS Console → Amplify**
2. **Click "New App" → "Deploy without Git"**
3. **Upload your FlutterBye ZIP file**
4. **Amplify will automatically detect it's a Node.js app**
5. **Click Deploy**

### Option B: Upload to GitHub first (Recommended)
1. **Create GitHub account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Create new repository called "flutterbye"**
3. **Upload your code to GitHub**
4. **AWS Console → Amplify**
5. **Click "New App" → "Host web app"**
6. **Connect GitHub → Select your flutterbye repo**
7. **Amplify handles the rest automatically**

## Step 5: Set Up Database (RDS)
1. **AWS Console → RDS**
2. **Create Database**
3. **Choose PostgreSQL**
4. **Template: Free tier**
5. **DB instance identifier: flutterbye-db**
6. **Master username: postgres**
7. **Set password** (write it down!)
8. **Create database** (takes 10-15 minutes)

## Step 6: Configure Environment Variables
1. **Go back to Amplify → Your app**
2. **Environment variables section**
3. **Add these variables:**
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_RDS_ENDPOINT:5432/postgres
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```
4. **Add your API keys:**
   - OPENAI_API_KEY
   - TWITTER_API_KEY
   - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
   - (any others you have)

## Step 7: Set Up Custom Domain
1. **Amplify → Domain management**
2. **Add domain: www.flutterbye.io**
3. **Follow DNS setup instructions**
4. **SSL certificate is automatic**

## What This Gives You:
- ✅ Automatic deployment from your code
- ✅ Secure hosting with SSL
- ✅ Database hosting
- ✅ Custom domain (www.flutterbye.io)
- ✅ Automatic scaling
- ✅ All managed by AWS

## Estimated Cost:
- Amplify: $5-15/month
- RDS (small): $15-25/month
- Total: ~$20-40/month

## Next Steps After Deployment:
1. Test your site at the Amplify URL
2. Set up custom domain
3. Continue developing on Replit
4. Deploy updates by pushing to GitHub

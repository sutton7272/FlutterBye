## 🟡 AREAS NEEDING ATTENTION (Minor Issues)

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Duplicate Methods in Storage** (Build Warnings)
   - `createRedemption` method duplicated 3 times
   - `getRedemptionsByWallet` method duplicated 2 times
   - **Impact:** Minor - functions work but creates build warnings
   - **Fix:** Remove duplicate method definitions

2. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Main bundle: 1.6MB (recommended: <500KB)
   - **Impact:** Slower initial load times
   - **Fix:** Implement code splitting and dynamic imports

3. **Browser Dependencies**
   - Browserslist data 10 months old
   - **Impact:** Minor - may affect browser compatibility
   - **Fix:** Update browserslist database

### Missing Production Features
1. **Error Logging Service**
   - No centralized error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
   - **Impact:** Difficult to debug production issues
   - **Priority:** Medium

2. **CDN Integration**
   - Assets served directly from server
   - **Impact:** Slower asset loading globally
   - **Priority:** Low

3. **Automated Testing**
   - No test suite for critical functions
   - **Impact:** Higher risk of regressions
   - **Priority:** Medium
